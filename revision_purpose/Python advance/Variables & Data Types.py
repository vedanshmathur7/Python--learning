# Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum. Ensure the inputs are converted to appropriate data types.

a = int (input ("Enter the no. 1 : "))
b = int (input ("Enter the no. 2 : "))
print (f'The sum of these two no.s is : {a+b}') 

# Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable. 
# For example, if a = 5 and b = 10, after swapping, a should be 10 and b should be 5.
